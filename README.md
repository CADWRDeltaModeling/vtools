# vtools
Time Series manipulation package in Python with usage in hydrodynamics and hydrology modeling.

This project is deprecated. You can still get it for a while here, but our efforts have been ported to Pandas and the remaining required functionality is provided in [vtools3](https://github.com/CADWRDeltaModeling/vtools3)
