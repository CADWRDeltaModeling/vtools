initial release tag

1.0.1

a fix on dss_service when ztsinfox return non found path for the path containing empty ending and starting subpath, like /A/B/C/01DEC1955-01JAN1956/E/F/, whose
/A/B/C/01JAN1956/E/F/ is empty. Fixing is done by using the begin of the last subpath as the end of whole ts.

1.0.2

kijin update:
Update index_before, index_after, _get_span according to the design
The functions are updated to manage cases more clearly when the given times do not fall inside of the time series. Tests are added for those functions.

qshu update:

add a group module to split a time series into a number of smaller ts according to input gap size. 
This group module is created to handle the dss path where there are huge gaps, which caused
huge dss file when such a ts is saved to a file. With those gaps are deleted before storing 
timeseres, the result dss file will be much smaller
