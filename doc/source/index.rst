=================
Introduction
=================
Vtools is a package to perform time-aligned operations on time series, as well as some specialty analyses encountered in hydrology and hydrodynamic work and modeling. The goal of vtools is to fill in around tools like `pandas <http://pandas.sourceforge.net/>`_  and `netcdf4-python <http://unidata.github.io/netcdf4-python/>`_ and to provide a bridge between netcdf and the legacy format HEC-DSS from the Hydrologic Engineering Center of the Army Corps of Engineers.

Documentation 
====================
Learning vtools is something you can mostly learn by example, so most of the topics below are coding examples with a few explanations. There is some traditional api documentation as well.
